# Zomato Data Analysis
In this project, I worked with the Zomato dataset to perform data cleaning and preprocessing using Python. I conducted comprehensive data analysis to extract insights and addressed several business-related questions. The results were visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn, showcasing key patterns and trends in the dataset.
